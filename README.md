# Lost-Saga-Discord-Presence
A Lost Saga script that enables discord rich presence through screenshot

Currently at proof of concept stage. To run it, you need to install python and tesseract OCR.

# To-Do:
- Compability: needs to recognize all different types of room and presence
- Language: both UI and rich presence
- Game recognition: by checking the folder from the process, guess which Lost Saga client it belongs to
